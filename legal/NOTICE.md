MELS is an open technical standard.  
It does not replace any national or international law, nor any intellectual property institution.

The NFT MELS:
- is not a trademark filing,
- does not grant legal rights,

Platforms implementing MELS are not responsible for legal interpretation of the standard.

Blockchain timestamps may serve as proof of prior use but do not replace official filings.
