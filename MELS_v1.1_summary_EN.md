# MELS v1.1 — Summary (EN)

## Definition
The NFT MELS is a master NFT containing only the creator’s 3D logo.  
It acts as an identity anchor, a temporal reference, and a geometric standard for all 3D NFTs using the MELS method.

## Key Points

- Traceability based on:
  - embedded logo (projection / contouring / profiling)
  - creator’s wallet
  - creation date
- 3D NFTs created before the NFT MELS remain valid

## Legal
- Not a trademark filing
- Does not replace any legal institution
- Traditional proofs must be kept
- Blockchain timestamp may prove prior use

## AI
